functional programming stuff for Swift.  i intend to de-jankify this README + repo in the near future, so bear with me.

README coming soon.  (honestly it's just a **shitload** of basic functions for basic types, collections (including strings), for `LlamaKit`'s `Result` type, etc.  use whatever seems useful.)
